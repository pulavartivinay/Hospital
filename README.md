## Guidelines to contributors
- pull the code
- start working only on the folders corresponding to the work associated to you. For example, if you are assigned `patient` and `billing`, then you are only supposed to work and push to those corresponding folders
- All the folders contain a html file, which is to be edited minimally
- You can add any other files in your folder, like php or html files, but the main starting point should be the html file already given in the folder(meaning all the file redirection should happen from the already given html file)
- Try to keep minimal number php(having add_, edit_, delete_ files is not efficient, try to have only one modify_, file which does every modification to the database, and one show_ file which just shows and not modifies the database) and html files
